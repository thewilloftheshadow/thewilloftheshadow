# Hey there, I'm Shadow

## About Me
I'm a professional Discord bot developer and server administrator, working on projects such as [Kiai](https://kiaibot.com) with my development studio, [Buape Studios](https://buape.com)

My favorite thing to work on are projects that are more than just the standard cookie-cutter portfolios or moderation Discord bots. Instead, I enjoy working on projects and concepts that are unique.


Thanks for checking out my profile (and stalking me)!
