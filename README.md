# Hey there, I'm Shadow

## About Me
I'm a professional Discord bot developer and server admistrator, working on projects such as [The Narwhal](https://narwhal.cool) and [The Mountain Adventure](https://discord.gg/themountain).<br><br>

My favorite thing to work on is Discord bots that are outside the typical moderation, leveling, etc bots.<br>
I like to make fun and unique ideas, such as [Minstrel](), a project/community I'm working on that allows you to write and play your own second-person (also known as pick-your-path) stories and publish them to the world!<br>

## For Hire
I am available to work on your Discord project in two different ways. <br>
- First, I am on Fiverr and I sell various gigs related to Discord. You can check that out [by clicking here](https://www.fiverr.com/lifeinhisshadow?up_rollout=true)<br>
- Second, my DMs are always open if you want to directly commission me, and I can provide proof that I know what I'm doing and help you flesh out your idea before settling on a commission. I'm very flexible, and want you to be able to see your ideas come to life, instead of squeeze every bit of money I can out of you.<br>

Thanks for checking out my profile (and stalking me)!
